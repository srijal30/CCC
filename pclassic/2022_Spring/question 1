/*
A K-Pop producer Ishaan is extremely angry with his lazy backstage dancers while filming the next BlackRed music video! 
To punish them, he gives them each a letter to hold (which come together to form a string) and then yells out a series of positive integers. 
For each integer, the dancers must shift right by that amount, but must “wrap” around the right end so that their position in line has changed. 
(ex.With each call, some rightmost dancers will have moved to the leftmost side.) Can you write a program that determines the final string after he finally loses his voice?

Implementation Details

Implement the following function. It will be called by the grader once for each test case.

danceCommand(s, arr)

s: a string that represents the initial string
arr: an array of positive integers that represent the “right shifts” of the string
Your function should return a string.

Input Format
The first line represents the number of test cases T. For each test case:

The first line contains s.
The second line contains n, the length of the array.
The third line contains arr which consists of n integer values, each denoted as x.
Output Format
For each test case, print a string representing the shifted string.

Constraints
1≤|string|≤10000
1≤|arr|≤10000
0≤x≤100000 where x is an element of arr.
